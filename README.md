# SEDS-HW2
Homework #2 from SEDS


### Assignment
1. Create a new Jupyter notebook called 'SEDS-HW2.ipynb' and finish the in class exercise of creating a block of code to download the HCEPDB data, unzip it and load it into a data frame in Python (not using %% bash magic!) so that it works for a single file.  
2. Use this same block of code in three different cells, with Markdown in between them, for each of the three files below:
	  
	| URL | filename | csv_filename |
	|-----|----------|--------------|
	| http://faculty.washington.edu/dacb/HCEPDB_moldata_set1.zip | HCEPDB_moldata_set1.zip | HCEPDB_moldata_set1.csv |
	| http://faculty.washington.edu/dacb/HCEPDB_moldata_set2.zip | HCEPDB_moldata_set2.zip | HCEPDB_moldata_set2.csv |
	| http://faculty.washington.edu/dacb/HCEPDB_moldata_set3.zip | HCEPDB_moldata_set3.zip | HCEPDB_moldata_set3.csv |

3. In a separate set of cells, use functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries, for loops, if statements, and whatever other tasty Python bits you want to run your code on the three files so that you don't replicate code as was done in the first approach. **Make sure you show both approaches from questions 2 and 3 in your notebook for full credit.**
4. Using Markdown in the notebook, describe how using these features of Python made your code shorter, more easy to read, and easier to maintain. Which approach was better and why?
5. Use visualizations or other tools to identify the difference between the three data sets.
